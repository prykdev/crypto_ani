I was just exploring about some new trending technology like Web3.0, NFT blockchain and cryptocurrency and got to know about hashnode thirdweb hackathon and this made me even more interested to learn about this and make a project using thirdweb which makes the work easy even if you don't know how to code in solidity.

# What is web3?
It makes sense to understand Web 3 by first understanding what came before it. Web 1 The first version of the Internet – originally aired in the late 1990s and consisted of a collection of links and homepages. Websites were not very interactive. You couldn't do much except read and publish basic content for others to read.

Web 2 was up next. Some refer to this as the "read/write" internet, referring to a computer code that allows you to open and edit files rather than just view them. This version of the Internet allowed people to create their own content and publish it on blogs like Tumblr, Internet forums, and marketplaces like Craigslist. Later, the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram catapulted content sharing to new heights.

Web3 is currently in-progress and isn’t exactly defined yet. However, the main principle is that it will be decentralized, In Web 3, these shares are called tokens or cryptocurrencies, and they represent ownership of decentralized networks known as blockchains

## What is ThirdWeb?
Smart contracts you control. Tools that accelerate your workflow. Intuitive SDKs and widgets for developers. It makes the work easy even if you don't know how to code in solidity then also you can build dapps (dementalized web applications)
